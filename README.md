A game for people that stare at Windows Spotlight images too much. Created in Electron and React.

## Get Started

Clone the repository and cd into the directory. In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

This will open a local electron desktop app to play the game. Only a single user is currently allowed to write to the firebase db.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br />
Currently only tested in MacOS.
